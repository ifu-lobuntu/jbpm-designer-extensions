# jBPM NRP

#1 Overview
The purpose of this jBPM NRP is to provide a modeling facility combined with a runtime execution engine that can facilitate networked economic collaboration.
As a type of resource planning system, jBPM NRP may, on the surface at least, appear to have goals similar to traditional ERP systems. However, on closer inspection, 
it in fact represents a massive paradigm shift from traditional ERP. The best introduction to this paradigm shift is to explore the ways in which it differs from 
traditional ERP systems. 

## The scope of jBPM NRP is the network, not the enterprise
In ERP, the Enterprise is central to the offering. Existing ERP solutions work hard to fortify the borders of the Enterprise. Auditability, accountability, cross-checking, double verification, balancing the books are implemented to make sure that nobody outside the Enterprise can possibly cheat it out of a penny. The processes it implements have been use for decades, some for centuries and have been proven to maximise the safety of the Enterprise.
For an NRP system, the Network is primary. Borders amongst Enterprises are secondary, and all Enterprises in the Network are treated equally. This does not mean that participants are expected to blindly trust each other, it is just that the technology built into the NRP solution itself obsoletes old accounting processes that were required to establish trust before the advent of the highly technologically connected world of the 21st century. Entirely new processes are possible whilst cross-boundary exchanges can be facilitated with much greater ease and improved techonological security.

## jBPM NRP does not implement set of practices, but provides the vocabulary to define and facilitate practices.
As stated above, the accounting practices implemented by existing ERP systems have become unnecessarily cumbersome for today's interconnected world. jBPM NRP could have chosen to address this by implementing a new set of revolutionary accounting practices. However, given that the rate of technological change is ever increasing, such an effort would produce software that will be relevant for an even shorter period than the age of ERP's. It is impossible to predict which accounting practices would be best even just 5 years from now. It would therefore be short sighted of jBPM NRP to adopt such an approach. Instead it aims to provide the building blocks, the vocabulary to allow business modelers and users to explore and define, and continue to evolve entirely new and innovative accounting practices. It is up to the modeler, developer and user in a value network to continuously reinvent it's own economic practices and deal up with the pressures of technological advancement that they face.

## In jBPM NRP, gain or loss is a matter of perspective.
In implementing jBPM NRP, this concept challenged our thinking over and over. Because there is no single Enterprise in NRP, there is no inflow contrasted with ouflow. There is only flow from one participant to another. A lot of the "balancing" work that is required in traditional accounting have become more of a distraction than an aid. Yes, jBPM NRP still keeps track of all flow of resources, it is just that it keeps track of increases and decreases on both sides of the equation, both the recipient and the provider, and it needs to do so without prejudice. It needs to have an entirely decentralized yet consistent general ledger. Any participant could be a supplier, any could be a consumer. It is always a matter of context and perspective.

## Business Relationship management rather than Supply Chain Management
In a networked collaboration, business partners are ephemeral things. Traditional ERP systems address the risk of transacting with business partner with the help of strong document management capabilities to store all the legal documentation, contracts and certificates associated with a business partner, and to tie the business partner down legally. However, in jBPM NRP the focus is on the how to manage business relationships more accurately. It allows both participants to negotiate the terms of an exchange and negotiated it very quickly and easily. In fact this negotiation process is the only built in process in jBPM NRP, and it can literally be invoked from any context, and its negotiated result is available should a dispute arise. The relationship resulting from such a negotiation is exactly as long as it needs to be for both parties. It can end after a single once off immediate exchange. It can last for a certain step in a project. It can last for an entire project. As the relationship duration becomes longer, jBPM NRP provides more measurement information to assess the health of a relationship. Rather than relying on formal documentation to reduce the risk of transacting, it provides the potential transactor with highly contextual information pertaining to the context, relationship within which the intended exchange occurs. 
     
## Business Relationship management rather than Customer Relationship Managenement
At the risk of repeatin the previous paragraph, everything that was said there can be said w.r.t. how jBPM NRP handles customers. All business relationships are handled uniformly, whether it is with a supplier or a customer. In a networked collaboration, it is often difficult to predict the multiplicity of suppliers as compared to the multiplicity of customers, and often customers can also become suppliers. There is therefore no point in giving structuring the B2C and B2B relationships any differently. Ultimately, any relationship is really just between two participants, and exactly the same negotiation process is supported in all relationships. The focus on relationships in jBPM NRP also allows it to leverage existing social platforms to harvest relationship information, but then to enrich this information with more useful contextual information as it emerges from a history of exchanges.

## Business Relationship management rather than Human Resource Managenement
Ditto. The employee-employer relationship is just another business relationship. And it is up to each business and their employees to uniquely define the relationship that they have.

In exploring how jBPM NRP differs from ERP solutions, we have alluded to a new style of economic activity we called "networked economic collaboration". Given how important this style of economic activity is for the paradigm shift jBPM NRP represents, a deeper exploration of this style of economic activity is warranted.

#2 The Networked Economy.
There are currently many different economic initiatives that claim to provide an alternative to today's problematic world economy whilst leveraging the highly interconnected world of the 21st century. Examples are the Circular Economy, Commons-based Peer production, Peer to Peer business, the Sharing Economy, Open Enterprises, Open Manufacturing, Open Value Networks, Collaborative Consumption, Collaborative Economy. Some of these put forward more extreme viewpoints than others, but generally there is no need to become overly apocalyptic for readers to understand that a fundamental shift is underway in how we think about doing business. jBPM NRP aims to support the entire spectrum of potential business models that could emerge from these different approaches.

jBPM NRP does not necessarily adhere to any specific school of thought, but we view the proliferation of so many similar approaches to economic activity as evidence of a convergence, an inevitable conclusion of today's increasingly technologically interconnected world. We would consider it a failure if jBPM NRP does not at least support all of these schools of thought. We will use the intentionally vague and hopefully slightly more neutral  term "Networked Economy" to refer to this set of economic initiatives and styles that are emerging with today's increasingly technologically interconnected world. 

## From chain to stream to network

## Blurred organizational boundaries and increased horizontal integration.

## Collaboration and competition
Traditionally it was easy to determine when to collaborate and when to compete in the business world. Generally the safest bet was to compete with another business as if it was our mortal enemy, unless it could be proven that the Enterprise under discussion owned both businesses. However, in the connected world collaboration often has a benefit, and not just a long term benefit but an immediate benefit. Collaboration can, paradoxically, give a business the competitive edge. Previously unlikely bedfellows now come together to develop shared infrastructure. Open Source software clearly illustrates this principle, but world wide mobile network operators are starting to sell their network infrastructures to common third parties shared with competitors. For outsiters such a move may seem drastic, but the reality is that the rapid advances in technology leaves business leaders with little choice: adapt and collaborate or die. 

This is not to say that competition will disappear. Competition is part of human nature, or even nature itself, some would argue, and is unlikely to disappear any time soon. However, the pressure to collaborate forces potential competitors to better refine their offerings, often in such a way that they do not compete anymore, or at least that the domain within which they compete is very clearly defined, and that the differences in their offering are well understood.  A much more sophisticated language is required today to clearly distinguish when another participant is a competitor, and when it is actually a business partner. The reality is that each and every relationship in the networked economy is best understood in terms of give and take, even those with competitors.

Another very important aspect of competition that is enjoing prominence today is where competition is not free and fair. In a previous era, every Enterprise aimed to establish a monopoly, but in today's age of social media, an Enterprises perceived to leveraging its monopoly risks loosing out very badly. Most individuals today understand that increased transparency is likely to result in reduced chances at unfair competition, collusion and discrimination, but what we have in social media and the free and open internet is the possibility of systemic catastrophe, not only for Enterprises but even governments when incriminating information is leaked.

## New models of ownership, especially w.r.t. software, data and knowledge.

## Open, adaptive processes.

## Moving away from centralized governance to more decentralized governance.

## More efficient use of resources due to economies of scale.
The network economy drastically changes the multiplicity of relationships. Customers become suppliers, suppliers become customers. In a traditional corporate environment, an orgunit's choice in who to do business with was simplified drastically due the rigidity provided by corporate structures. However, in the network economy, such artificial limits on who to exchange with fall away. This could be beneficial, but also complicates matters. New criteria of looking for potential collaborators need to be found, focused more on location (efficient distance) and resource availability, and quality criteria are more important than ever. However, the economic agent itself also finds itself similarly lost in a multitude of similarly qualified economic agents. Thus participants need to read the market effectively to understand how it should best position it in the economic landscape. How to make sure your enterprise is the one that will be chosen. And more significantly, the economic agent sometimes needs to acknowledge that there are certain conditions under which they need to join forces with their competitors, as together they can leverage economies of scale, and get access to resources at much lower cost, thus delivering value at a more competitive price.

##Transparancy. 
Traditionally, businesses preferred to do some initial due diligence to identify potential business partners. However, after a choice is made, a lot of the transparency involved in that initial process disappears. The implicit incorrect assumption here is that everythin stays the same - old business partners remain reliable, and the risk involved in doing business with them continues to remain low. However, in an environment where technology changes business practices on a monthly basis, this assumption is inappropriate. The only way to reevualate the risk a specific business relationship entails is to have access to exactly the same type of information that was acquired during the initial due diligence. Transparency in the Network Economy is therefore like an ongoing due diligence process.

## Focuses more on the immediate characteristics of capabilities and products offered rather than qualifications, certifications, decades of experience.

## Probing questions about the social and environmental sustainability of business practices.
After several consecutive system economic failures, today's person on the street is much more aware of the effects of self centric perspectives on resource consumption. Continued economic development on a finite set of resources is mathematically impossible, and the myth of sustainable development is now making place for the reality of inevitable retreat. Viewing economic exchange solely from the perspective of what the self is to gain from it is becoming increasinly politically incorrect, and questions need to be answer as to what is given back to the community and the environment in an economic exchange. We are still very far from some idilic selfless society, and realisticly speaking it will remain idilic, but questions of social and environmental impact are becoming more and more difficult to dodge, and business leaders are looking for ways to better answer these questions.

##4 Blockchain technology
Essential for inventory levels that could have meaning in other context, such as Account Balance.
Also useful for reputation ratings that could have meaning in other contexts.
Provides an excellent infrastructure for auditable decision making processes, which would allow collaborations to become self-governing yet have full accountability and transparancy.
It is also entirely conceivable that certain Collaborations could be instantiated on geographically separated nodes. Blockchain ensures that, irrespective of where that Collaboration is running from, the changes in real inventory levels are reflected everywhere.
