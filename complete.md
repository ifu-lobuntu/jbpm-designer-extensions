#Automate marshalling:
 - boundaryShapes property implemented as ConnectionRule.targetBinding
 - sourceBinding
 - targetBindings
 - childBindings
 - viewBindings
 - Laying out decorations sequentially, spaced evenly, but only the visible ones 

# Modularization
 - Implement different projects for different modeling languages - Client/API/Backend
 - Implement processRequest method on profile to delegate to the appropriate action handler
 - Implement redirection logic in StencilSetServiceServlet
 - Config.js

#Misc
